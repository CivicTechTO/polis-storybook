# Overview: Client-Deliberation

This section presents components from [an unofficial fork of Polis][repo-dev] maintained by the University of Texas Austin's [Human-AI Interaction Lab][UT-HAI].

- There is no publicly hosted version that we're aware of.
- We do not represent the institution, but simply wish to make it easier to view their UIs.
- They work on the `HAI-dev` branch (not the default `main` branch) and an in-progress branch called `Tutorial`.
- In this storybook, we only show the `HAI-dev` components.
- The most interesting work of their repo is in a directory called [`client-deliberation/`][repo-dev-dir], where they have converted many legacy components to React, and merged the upstream [`client-admin`][upstream-admin] and [`client-participatin`][upstream-participation] apps into one app.
- The repo is active and seems to exist for an ongoing research project.
