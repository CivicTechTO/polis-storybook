# Overview: Client-Deliberation

This section presents components from [an unofficial fork of Polis][repo-dev] maintained by the University of Texas Austin's [Human-AI Interaction Lab][UT-HAI].

- There is no publicly hosted version that we're aware of.
- We do not represent the institution, but simply wish to make it easier to view their UIs.
- No meaningful work happens in the default `main` branch.
- The most interesting work of their repo is in a directory called [`client-deliberation/`][repo-dev-dir],
  where they have converted many legacy components to React,
  and merged the upstream [`client-admin`][upstream-admin] and [`client-participation`][upstream-participation] apps into one app.
- The repo hosts two main branches of interest:
    - `HAI-dev`: a conversion of legacy BackboneJS views into modern React components, as well as a merger as explained above. 
    - `Tutorial`: an additional in-progress branch building on `HAI-dev`, with many additional onboarding- and AI-based components.
- In this storybook, we present components from the full `Tutorial` branch.
- The UT-HAI repo is active and seems to exist for an ongoing research project.
